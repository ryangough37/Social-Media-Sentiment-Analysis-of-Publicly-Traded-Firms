# Neural Network Classifiers

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Juptyer Notebooks

## Description

### 1. Neural Network Classifier with Scikit
The first section of this project aims to use Scikit-learn to perform classification. Using the multi-label classifier on reddit comments, I fit a neural network classifier using scikit-learn.  Reported the accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

### 2. Neural Network Classifier with Keras
The first section of this project aims to use Keras to perform classification.Using the multi-label classifier on reddit comments, I fit a neural network classifier using scikit-learn.  Reported the accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
